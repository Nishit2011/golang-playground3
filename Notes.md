What is maps?
Key-Value pair data structure where bith key and value is statically typed
Whenever we add some number of keys to a map,they must be of same exact type
And all the values must also be of the exact same type
keys and values can be of diff type,but all keys and all values must be of same type

Whenever we declare a new variable and do not assign an actual value to it, go will initialize it with its zero value 

maps are a 'reference type', which means when we pass them to a function and modify them we are modifying the original map, not a copy
